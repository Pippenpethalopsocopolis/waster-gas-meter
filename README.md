# water-gas-meter
This is an API that reads you water and gas from water/gas meter using Gemini AI. You need Gemini Developer API key to use this.

Docker should handle mysql and node.js setup.

You can change api key and ports from the docker-compose.yml

You can also use .env file for ports and api key.

## Thanks for your time!
